.SH "NAME"
mkvimball-sh, mkvimball \- create a vimball archive
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBmkvimball\-sh\fP \fIarchive\fP \fIfile\fP ...
.br
\fBmkvimball\fP \fIarchivebase\fP \fIfile\fP ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBmkvimball\-sh\fP utility copies the contents of the files named by the
\fIfile\fP operands to a vimball archive at \fIarchive\fP.
.sp
If installed, the \fBmkvimball\fP shim provides drop\-in compatibility with
Charles E. Campbell\(cqs original \fBmkvimball\fP.
It rejects \fIarchivebase\fP if it contains a "." character; otherwise, it
writes the archive to
\fIarchivebase\fP.\fIvba\fP.
(See COMPATIBILITY for details.)
.sp
Within this document, "the utilities" refers to both \fBmkvimball\-sh\fP and
the \fBmkvimball\fP shim.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
None.
.sp
A leading "\-\-" argument is not recognized as a delimiter indicating the
end of options but is used as the first operand.  This behavior may
change in a future version.
.SH "OPERANDS"
.sp
The following operands are supported by \fBmkvimball\-sh\fP:
.sp
\fIarchive\fP
.RS 4
The pathname of the vimball archive to be written.  If a file exists at
\fIarchive\fP, it is overwritten.  If the \fIarchive\fP operand is "\-", it
refers not to standard output but to a file named
\fI\-\fP;
this behavior may change in a future version of \fBmkvimball\-sh\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fIfile\fP
.RS 4
A pathname of a file to be copied into the vimball archive.  The value
of the operand itself is also included in the archive.  If a \fIfile\fP
operand is "\-", it refers not to standard input but to a file named
\fI\-\fP.
.RE
.sp
The following operands are supported by the \fBmkvimball\fP shim:
.sp
\fIarchivebase\fP
.RS 4
A partial pathname used to determine where to write the vimball archive.
.sp
If the \fIarchivebase\fP operand contains a "." character, \fBmkvimball\fP
writes a diagnostic message to standard error and exits with a nonzero
status.  (See COMPATIBILITY.)
.sp
Otherwise, the archive is written to the pathname formed by
concatenating \fIarchivebase\fP and ".vba".  If a file exists there, it is
overwritten.  If the \fIarchivebase\fP operand is "\-", it refers not to
standard output but to a file named
\fI\-.vba\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fIfile\fP
.RS 4
Same as for \fBmkvimball\-sh\fP.
.RE
.SH "STDIN"
.sp
Not used, although this may change in a future version.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
.sp
The input files specified as operands must be
text files as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1\-2017 (POSIX.1\-2017).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.sp
The \fILANG\fP, \fILC_ALL\fP, \fILC_CTYPE\fP, \fILC_MESSAGES\fP, \fINLSPATH\fP, and \fIPATH\fP
environment variables affect the execution of the utilities and their
child processes in the usual manner.
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
.sp
The standard action is taken for all signals.
.SH "STDOUT"
.sp
Not used, although this may change in a future version.
.SH "STDERR"
.sp
The standard error is used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
.sp
The output file is a vimball archive.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.sp
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
0
.RS 4
The vimball archive was created successfully.
.RE
.sp
>0
.RS 4
An error occurred.
.RE
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
.sp
If the utilities encounter an error, they exit with a nonzero status and
do not process any further input files.  A partial vimball archive may
be produced.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
.sp
The modern, preferred suffix for vimball archive pathnames is ".vmb".
Unless compatibility is a concern, applications should avoid giving
archives the legacy ".vba" suffix.
.sp
The \fIfile\fP operands are embedded in the output archive and are used
for constructing destination pathnames during extraction.  Thus, the
utilities must be invoked from a directory that permits passing the
proper pathnames.  For example, given this directory structure...
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
/home
`\-\- dave
    `\-\- src
        `\-\- ex1
            |\-\- autoload
            |   `\-\- ex1.vim
            |\-\- doc
            |   `\-\- ex1.txt
            `\-\- plugin
                `\-\- ex1.vim
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
\&...the
\fIex1\fP
plugin could be packaged using the following Bourne shell command:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
cd /home/dave/src/ex1 \(rs
    && mkvimball\-sh ex1.vmb \(rs
        autoload/ex1.vim doc/ex1.txt plugin/ex1.vim
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The utilities produce invalid vimball archives if given input files that
do not end with a LF character (ASCII 10\~/ 0x0A\~/ 0o12) or
that terminate lines with CR (ASCII 13\~/ 0x0D\~/ 0o15) or CRLF.
Applications must convert such files to compliant text files (see
INPUT FILES) before using them with the utilities; they can also be
handled with the vimball Vim plugin.
.sp
The utilities provide no facility for embedding values of the Vim
\fIfileencoding\fP
option into archives.  Applications should consider restricting input to
ASCII characters to avoid relying on Vim\(cqs encoding heuristics during
extraction.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The following command creates a vimball archive named
\fIex3.vmb\fP:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
mkvimball\-sh ex3.vmb autoload/ex3.vim doc/ex3.txt plugin/ex3.vim
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The following command creates a vimball archive named
\fIex5.vba\fP
using the \fBmkvimball\fP shim:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
mkvimball ex5 autoload/ex5.vim doc/ex5.txt plugin/ex5.vim
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.sp
Charles E. Campbell\(cqs original \fBmkvimball\fP
rejects archive pathnames that contain "." characters.  The \fBmkvimball\fP
shim retains this behavior, but \fBmkvimball\-sh\fP accepts such pathnames.
.sp
The original \fBmkvimball\fP appends ".vba" to those archive pathnames that
it does accept.  The \fBmkvimball\fP shim retains this behavior, but
\fBmkvimball\-sh\fP uses all operands as given.
.sp
If invoked without any input pathnames, the original \fBmkvimball\fP enters
an interactive mode that prompts the user to enter pathnames.  Neither
\fBmkvimball\-sh\fP nor the \fBmkvimball\fP shim provides such a mode; all input
pathnames must be provided as operands.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Probably.
