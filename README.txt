This is a public-domain [1] rewrite of Charles E. Campbell's
`mkvimball` [2] utility for creating vimball [3] archives.  Written in
portable Bourne shell, it can serve as a replacement for noninteractive
uses on a wide range of Unix and Unix-like systems.  A shim is available
for drop-in compatibility with `mkvimball`.


Requirements
------------

-   A relatively recent Bourne or Bourne-compatible (including
    POSIX-conformant [4]) shell, available at `/bin/sh`.

-   The typical Unix utilities, plus a couple that could be considered
    atypical:

    -   `m4` [5] for creating the compatibility shim.
    -   `make` [6] for installation.

    POSIX conformance [7] is ideal, but minor transgressions are fine.

-   Asciidoctor [8] for regenerating the manual pages.  Only necessary
    if modifying the documentation source.


Installation / Uninstallation
-----------------------------

To install/uninstall the `mkvimball-sh` utility to/from `/usr/local`
(privileges required, presumably):

    cd /path/to/this/repo && make install
    cd /path/to/this/repo && make uninstall

To avoid overwriting the original `mkvimball`, the standard targets omit
the compatibility shim, which is also named `mkvimball`.  To install
both `mkvimball-sh` and the shim:

    cd /path/to/this/repo && make installshim

To uninstall the shim (but not `mkvimball-sh`):

    cd /path/to/this/repo && make uninstallshim

To use an installation prefix other than `/usr/local`, define the
`prefix` [9] macro when invoking `make`.  For example:

    cd /path/to/this/repo && make prefix=/opt installshim
    cd /path/to/this/repo && make prefix=/opt uninstall uninstallshim

The `bindir`, `datarootdir`, `exec_prefix`, `man1dir`, and `mandir`
macros are supported for unorthodox installation hierarchies [9].  The
`DESTDIR` macro is supported for staged installs [10].  The
`ASCIIDOCTOR`, `INSTALL`, `INSTALL_DATA`, `INSTALL_PROGRAM`, and `M4`
macros are supported for using alternate tools [11].


Usage
-----

    mkvimball-sh <outputfile> <inputfile> ...

The `mkvimball-sh` utility copies the contents of the text files [12]
named by the <inputfile> operands to a vimball archive at <outputfile>.

    mkvimball outputname inputfile ...

The `mkvimball` shim provides drop-in compatibility with the original
`mkvimball`.  It rejects <outputname> if it contains a "." character;
otherwise, it writes the archive to `<outputname>.vba`.

Consult the man page for more details.
