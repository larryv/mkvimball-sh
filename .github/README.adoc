This is a
{link-cc0}[public-domain, title={title-cc0}]
rewrite of Charles E. Campbell's
`{url-drchip}/src/index.html#MKVIMBALL[mkvimball]`
utility for creating
{url-drchip}/vim/index.html#VIMBALL[vimball]
archives.  Written in portable Bourne shell, it can serve as
a replacement for noninteractive uses on a wide range of Unix and
Unix-like systems.  A shim is available for drop-in compatibility with
`mkvimball`.

// TODO: List some reasons why this is better than the original.


== Requirements

* A relatively recent Bourne or Bourne-compatible (including
{url-posix}/utilities/V3_chap02.html[POSIX-conformant,
title="{title-posix} - Volume 3, Chapter 2 ('Shell Command Language')"])
shell, available at `/bin/sh`.

* The typical Unix utilities, plus a couple that could be considered
atypical:
+
--
** `{url-posix}/utilities/m4.html[m4,
title="{title-posix} - Volume 3, Chapter 4 ('Utilities - m4')"]`
for creating the compatibility shim.
** `{url-posix}/utilities/make.html[make,
title="{title-posix} - Volume 3, Chapter 4 ('Utilities - make')"]`
for installation.
--
+
{url-posix}/utilities/V3_chap04.html[POSIX conformance,
title="{title-posix} - Volume 3, Chapter 4 ('Utilities')"]
is ideal, but minor transgressions are fine.

* https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] for regenerating the manual
pages.  Only necessary if modifying the documentation source.


== Installation / Uninstallation

To install/uninstall the `mkvimball-sh` utility to/from `/usr/local`
(privileges required, presumably):

[source]
cd /path/to/this/repo && make install

[source]
cd /path/to/this/repo && make uninstall

To avoid overwriting the original `mkvimball`, the standard targets omit
the compatibility shim, which is also named `mkvimball`.  To install
both `mkvimball-sh` and the shim:

[source]
cd /path/to/this/repo && make installshim

To uninstall the shim (but not `mkvimball-sh`):

[source]
cd /path/to/this/repo && make uninstallshim

:title-gmake-man: GNU Make Manual
:title-gmake-man-cmdvars: {title-gmake-man} - \
    Variables for Specifying Commands
:title-gmake-man-dirvars: {title-gmake-man} - \
    Variables for Installation Directories
:url-gmake-man: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node
:url-gmake-man-cmdvars: {url-gmake-man}/Command-Variables.html
:url-gmake-man-dirvars: {url-gmake-man}/Directory-Variables.html

To use an installation prefix other than `/usr/local`, define the
`{url-gmake-man-dirvars}#index-prefix[prefix,
title={title-gmake-man-dirvars} - 'prefix']`
macro when invoking `make`.  For example:

[source]
cd /path/to/this/repo && make prefix=/opt installshim

[source]
cd /path/to/this/repo && make prefix=/opt uninstall uninstallshim

The
`{url-gmake-man-dirvars}#index-bindir[bindir,
title={title-gmake-man-dirvars} - 'bindir']`,
`{url-gmake-man-dirvars}[datarootdir,
title={title-gmake-man-dirvars}]`,
`{url-gmake-man-dirvars}#index-exec_005fprefix[exec_prefix,
title={title-gmake-man-dirvars} - 'exec_prefix']`,
`{url-gmake-man-dirvars}[man1dir,
title={title-gmake-man-dirvars}]`,
and
`{url-gmake-man-dirvars}[mandir,
title={title-gmake-man-dirvars}]`
macros are supported for unorthodox installation hierarchies.  The
`{url-gmake-man}/DESTDIR.html[DESTDIR]`
macro is supported for staged installs.  The `ASCIIDOCTOR` (with
`ASCIIDOCTORFLAGS`),
`{url-gmake-man-cmdvars}[INSTALL,
title={title-gmake-man-cmdvars}]`,
`{url-gmake-man-cmdvars}[INSTALL_DATA,
title={title-gmake-man-cmdvars}]`,
`{url-gmake-man-cmdvars}[INSTALL_PROGRAM,
title={title-gmake-man-cmdvars}]`,
and `M4` (with `M4FLAGS`) macros are supported for using alternate
tools.


== Usage

[source]
mkvimball-sh [-a] [-f archive] [--] [file ...]

The `mkvimball-sh` utility copies the contents of its input
{url-posix}/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_403[text files,
title="{title-posix} - Volume 1, Chapter 3, Section 403 ('Text File')"]
to a vimball archive.  The input files can be specified as _file_
operands or as a list of LF-terminated paths on standard input.  The
archive is written to standard output or, if `-f` is specified, to
_archive_.  If `-a` is specified, the archive header is omitted from the
output so it can be appended to an existing archive; if both `-a` and
`-f` are specified, _archive_ is appended to instead of overwritten.

[source]
mkvimball archivebase file ...

The `mkvimball` shim provides drop-in compatibility with the original
`mkvimball`.  It rejects _archivebase_ if it contains a "." character;
otherwise, it writes the archive to `__archivebase__.vba`.

Consult the xref:../mkvimball-sh.adoc[man page] for more details.
